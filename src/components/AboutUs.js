        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>Since 14 years, the Paris Cirucs Company produce unique circus theatre experiences in a wide variety of unusual locations, from circus big tops and traditional theatres to site specific and promenade performances in disused industrial and historical
        buildings. Based in the UK since 2002 the company draws much from its decade of travelling as a street performance troupe in the 90s, exploring Europeâ€™s rich performance culture and traditions working in arts and street festivals, carnivals
        and creation spaces.</p>
